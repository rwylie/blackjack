This was the second project I built at DigitalCrafts 16 week coding bootcamp. 

### Technologies used:

JavaScript | jQuery | HTML | CSS | Illustrator

### Challenges

This was my first real project created with JavaScript.  While figuring out the structure and order of things within the code was difficult,
the greatest challenge for me was refactoring the JavaScript to be object oriented.
